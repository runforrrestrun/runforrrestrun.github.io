            <strong>Maximum Withdrawal:</strong> €500 - €1500 per day, €10,000 -
            €20,000 monthly, depending on your VIP level.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Withdrawal Processing Times</h2>

        <p>
          While Wazamba offers a variety of instant withdrawal methods like
          Neteller, Skrill, and cryptocurrencies, other methods, such as bank
          transfers and card payments, may take between 1-5 business days.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s worth noting that withdrawals are processed only during business
          hours, from Monday to Friday, which can lead to slight delays,
          especially over the weekend. Additionally, Wazamba allows up to 3
          pending withdrawal requests at a time.
        </p>

        <h2>Anti-Money Laundering and KYC Compliance</h2>

        <p>
          Wazamba adheres to standard Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations,
          which means you must wager your last deposit at least once before
          requesting a withdrawal. Failing to meet this requirement could result
          in a fee, and the casino reserves the right to cancel any winnings in
          such cases. The platform also has a robust Know Your Customer (KYC)
          process in place, ensuring that all transactions are secure and
          verified.
        </p>

        <p>During the KYC process, you’ll need to provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A valid ID (passport, driver’s license)</li>
          <li>A utility bill or bank statement</li>
          <li>A clear photograph of your payment method (if required)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>💡</strong> Ensure that your documents are valid and clearly
          visible for quicker verification.
        </p>

        <h2>Cryptocurrency Transactions at Wazamba Casino</h2>

        <p>
          One of Wazamba Casino’s standout features is its support for
          cryptocurrencies. Players can deposit and withdraw using Bitcoin,
          Litecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. These transactions are processed
          instantly, providing an additional layer of privacy and convenience.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Bitcoin/Litecoin/Ethereum/Ripple:</strong> Instant deposits
            and withdrawals, with limits ranging from €10 to €10,000.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Wazamba Casino Payment Security</h2>

        <p>
          Wazamba Casino is owned and operated by Araxio Development N.V. and is
          licensed by the Curacao gaming authorities. Despite the occasional
          slow payment processing that some Curacao-licensed casinos are known
          for, Wazamba stands out as a reliable platform. All payment methods,
          including cryptocurrencies, are secure and legal.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts on Wazamba Casino's Payment System</h2>

        <p>
          Wazamba Casino offers a well-rounded payment system with an extensive
          range of deposit and withdrawal methods, including support for
          cryptocurrencies. While the casino processes withdrawals only on
          weekdays, the instant processing times for most methods make up for
          this limitation. Whether you're using traditional payment methods or
          modern options like Bitcoin, Wazamba ensures a safe and secure
          experience for its players.
