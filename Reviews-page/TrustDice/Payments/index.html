            payment options.
          </p>

          <h2>Overview of Payment Solutions</h2>
          <p>
            TrustDice exclusively operates on a cryptocurrency platform, making

          <p>
            Withdrawing funds from TrustDice is just as straightforward, with
            options available for all supported cryptocurrencies. Here’s a
            breakdown of the key aspects of withdrawal:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users must verify their email to initiate a withdrawal.</li>
            <li>
              The site does not impose fees for withdrawals, but network fees
              may apply based on the cryptocurrency chosen.
            </li>
            <li>
              The minimum withdrawal amount varies depending on the
              cryptocurrency used.
            </li>
            <li>
              Expected transaction times are between 5 to 10 minutes for most
              cryptocurrencies, depending on the network speed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>TrustDice's Own Token: TXT</h2>
          <p>
            TrustDice has its own cryptocurrency, known as TXT, built on the EOS
            blockchain. Holding TXT allows players to receive daily rewards,
            including a share of 50% of the games' profits. Players can acquire
            TXT through the platform's unique Crypto Faucet, which provides free
            crypto every six hours, enhancing player engagement.
          </p>

          <h2>Making Deposits and Withdrawals with Cryptocurrencies</h2>
          <p>
            To make deposits or withdrawals at TrustDice, follow these simple
            steps:
          </p>
          <ol>

              <strong>Login:</strong> Use your TrustDice account credentials.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Select Option:</strong> Navigate to the “Deposit +”
              section and choose either Deposit or Withdrawal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Deposit:</strong> For deposits, select your preferred
              cryptocurrency and click on “Get Address.” Copy this address for

              follow the provided instructions.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Additional Features: TrustDice Coinbox</h2>
          <p>
            TrustDice offers a feature called Coinbox, where active players can
            earn free cryptocurrency rewards. While there may not be a
            traditional no-deposit bonus, the Coinbox allows players to
            accumulate BTC, ETH, EOS, USDT, TXT, and USDC, enhancing the gaming
            experience.
          </p>

          <h2>Deposit and Withdrawal Fees</h2>
          <p>
            TrustDice does not charge any fees for deposits or withdrawals,
            apart from standard network fees associated with cryptocurrency
            transactions. It’s worth noting that while deposits are free, the
            minimum withdrawal amount must be met before funds can be withdrawn.
            The withdrawal limits are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Maximum withdrawal:</strong> €5,000 per day, €15,000 per
              week, and €50,000 per month.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Welcome Bonus</h2>
          <p>
            New players can take advantage of a generous welcome deposit bonus
            of up to 3 BTC or $90,000 USD, along with 25 free spins. The bonus
