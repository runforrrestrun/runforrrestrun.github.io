          <h1>Cloudbet – Payments & Banking Breakdown</h1>

          <h2>Overview of Payments</h2>
          <p>
            Cloudbet is primarily a crypto-native platform, designed for fast
            and secure digital currency transactions. At the same time, it
            supports fiat-to-crypto deposits and withdrawals, allowing players
            without cryptocurrency holdings to participate. This dual system
            ensures efficiency for crypto users and accessibility for fiat
            users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speed, transparency, and global reach (where permitted by law) make
            Cloudbet’s banking system a core part of the user experience,
            enabling smooth deposits, quick withdrawals, and flexible payment
            options for casual players and high-rollers alike.
          </p>

          <h2>Deposit Options</h2>

          <h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
          <p>
            Cloudbet supports a wide variety of cryptocurrencies for deposits.
            Major options include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
            <li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
            <li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>
            <li>Tether (USDT)</li>
            <li>USD Coin (USDC)</li>
            <li>
              Other altcoins: Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA),
              Polkadot (DOT)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Crypto deposits are processed almost instantly after blockchain
            confirmations. Minimum deposits vary by coin, sometimes as low as
            0.0001 BTC. Deposits are generally free from platform fees, though
            network fees are inherent to blockchain transfers. High-rollers
            benefit from the lack of a strict maximum deposit limit.
          </p>

          <h3>Fiat Deposits & On-Ramps</h3>
          <p>
            For users without cryptocurrency, Cloudbet provides several fiat
            options that convert into crypto:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>MoonPay:</strong> Allows purchases via credit/debit cards,
              Apple Pay, or Google Pay
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Other third-party wallets:</strong> Jeton or Vega in
              select jurisdictions
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Fiat deposits via these services may incur fees, and availability
            varies by country. Once the fiat is converted into crypto, the funds
            are immediately available for betting or casino games.
          </p>

          <h3>Deposit Features</h3>
          <p>
            Deposits are generally instant once blockchain confirmations or fiat
            conversions are complete. Crypto deposits have minimal fees and no
            strict limits, while fiat deposits depend on third-party providers’
            processing times and fees. Funds are ready for play immediately upon
            successful deposit.
          </p>

          <h2>Withdrawal Options</h2>

          <h3>Crypto Withdrawals</h3>
          <p>
            Withdrawals are primarily processed in the same cryptocurrency used
            for deposits. Options include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
            <li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
            <li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>
            <li>Tether (USDT)</li>
            <li>USD Coin (USDC)</li>
            <li>Other altcoins</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Standard withdrawals are often completed within minutes for verified
            accounts. Large withdrawals or flagged amounts may require manual
            verification, taking longer.
          </p>

          <h3>Fiat Withdrawals</h3>
          <p>
            For players who deposited via fiat, Cloudbet allows withdrawals
            through the same provider used for deposit (where supported). This
            generally involves converting crypto back into fiat and sending it
            to your bank account, credit/debit card, or third-party wallet.
            Processing times for fiat withdrawals can take longer than crypto,
            typically ranging from a few hours to a few business days, depending
            on the provider and jurisdiction.
          </p>

          <h3>Minimum & Limits</h3>
          <p>Withdrawal thresholds vary:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Crypto minimums can be as low as 0.0001 BTC (~$10 equivalent)
            </li>
            <li>
              Fiat minimums depend on provider limits and may be higher than
              crypto
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            High-rollers benefit from flexible limits, though large withdrawals
            may require additional verification to comply with KYC/AML
            regulations.
          </p>

          <h3>Fees & Processing</h3>
          <p>
            Cloudbet generally does not charge platform fees on crypto deposits
            or withdrawals, but network fees or third-party conversion fees may
            apply. Fiat withdrawals often incur provider fees and slightly
            longer processing times. Overall, crypto withdrawals are
            near-instant when verification requirements are met.
          </p>

          <h3>Security & Verification</h3>
          <p>
            All transactions use SSL encryption. Most funds are kept in cold
            wallets for security, with hot wallets handling daily liquidity.
            Two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended. KYC verification is
            mandatory for large withdrawals or accounts flagged for compliance,
            which may include proof of identity, address, or payment method.
          </p>

          <h3>Currency Support & Country Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            Cloudbet supports numerous cryptocurrencies, giving players from
            multiple regions the ability to participate. Fiat options broaden
            access in areas where users do not hold crypto. However,
            availability depends on local regulations and providers—MoonPay or
            other wallets may not be accessible everywhere. Players should
            confirm that gambling is legal in their region and that their
            selected payment method is supported before depositing.

          <h2>Key Tips & What to Watch</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Carefully select your account’s base currency, as Cloudbet may
              lock it to the first deposit currency.
            </li>
            <li>Use crypto for faster, more private transactions.</li>
            <li>Check fees and conversion rates when using fiat on-ramps.</li>
            <li>
              Complete KYC verification before attempting large withdrawals to
              avoid delays.
            </li>
            <li>
              Match deposit and withdrawal methods/currencies to reduce
              compliance risks.
            </li>
            <li>Large withdrawals may trigger manual review.</li>
            <li>
              Always review terms and conditions, including minimums, expected
              processing times, and geographic restrictions.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Cloudbet provides a highly flexible and secure banking system
            suitable for both cryptocurrency and fiat users. Fast deposits,
            broad crypto support, and near-instant withdrawals make it appealing
            for high-rollers and casual players alike. Fiat on-ramps extend
            access to users without crypto holdings, though these often involve
            third-party fees and may have regional restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The combination of speed, flexibility, security, and wide currency
            support makes Cloudbet’s payment system one of the platform’s
            strongest features. Players should ensure their region supports the
            platform, complete KYC verification for large withdrawals, and be
            aware of any fees when converting between fiat and crypto.
