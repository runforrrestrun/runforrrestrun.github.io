          <h3>Gameplay Overview</h3>
          <p>Most Bitcoin slots feature:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Three or more reels: Spin to win with traditional and modern
              designs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Special symbols: Look for Wilds, Scatters, and Bonus symbols that
              unlock unique features.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            New players are encouraged to start with low volatility slots, which
            offer a more forgiving gaming experience with frequent, smaller
            wins.
          </p>

          <h3>Understanding Volatility and RTP</h3>
          <p>
            The volatility of a slot game affects the frequency and size of
            payouts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Low Volatility:</strong> Provides frequent, smaller wins,
              perfect for beginners.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Medium Volatility:</strong> Offers a balanced mix of wins
              and payouts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>High Volatility:</strong> Features less frequent but
              potentially larger wins, ideal for risk-takers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Return to Player (RTP) percentage indicates the average amount
            returned to players over time. A good RTP generally hovers around
            96%, providing players with a fair chance to win.
          </p>
